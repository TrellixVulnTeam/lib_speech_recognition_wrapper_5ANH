Docs needed, sorry

* Install instructions
    * ```sudo apt-get -Y install libpulse-dev```
    * ```sudo apt-get -Y install swig```
    * ```sudo apt-get -Y install libasound2-dev```

* TODO
    * When recording audio, cut off the first and last bit of sounds
    * They recommend less than 200ms
    * Also augment sound through pitch and volume?
    * Long term, train your own model?
